## 🌱✨ Inspiration

Starting at a new school can be overwhelming—new faces, unfamiliar buildings, and no clear support system. **ABA BUD** was built to reduce that anxiety and ensure that every student feels supported, connected, and informed from day one. Our goal was to blend navigation tools with social integration to create a seamless onboarding experience.
